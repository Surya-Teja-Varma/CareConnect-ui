## üöß Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Creating smooth, performant hover effects for doctor cards  
**Solution**: Leveraged GPU-accelerated CSS `transform` and `box-shadow` for 3D-like lifting effects without layout shifts.

### Challenge 2: Making the layout fully responsive  
**Solution**: Used Tailwind's responsive grid classes like `md:grid-cols-2`, `lg:grid-cols-3` to create adaptive layouts and followed a strict mobile-first approach.

### Challenge 3: Theme toggle and animated appointment counter  
**Solution**: Theme toggle state was saved in `localStorage` with CSS transitions between light/dark modes. The appointment counter was made interactive with a `setInterval` and stored count in `localStorage` to simulate urgency.
